# kobe_movie_challenge

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Use dependences:
   cupertino_icons: Give more Icons options
   equatable:  Being able to compare objects in Dart often involves having to override the == operator as well as hashCode.
   flutter_bloc: BlocBuilder is a Flutter widget which requires a Bloc and a builder function. BlocBuilder handles building the widget in response to new states.
   http: This package contains a set of high-level functions and classes that make it easy to consume HTTP resources.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
